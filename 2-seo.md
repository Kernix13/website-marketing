## Keyword research

The process of discovering and analyzing the words and phrases people type into search engines. Keywords help you discover what your audience is looking for, tailor your content to meet their needs, and improve your website’s ranking in search results.

### Long-tail vs. short-tail keywords:

- Short-tail keywords are shorter and more generic
- long-tail keywords are longer and more specific

### User intent (Primary Keyword): why people are searching

- Are they looking for information?
- Are they trying to purchase something?
- Or are they simply seeking an answer to their problem?

### Buyer’s journey

- A buyer’s journey consists of three stages: awareness, consideration, and decision
- Tailor your content to meet them halfway
- In the awareness stage, users are identifying a problem.
- In the next stage, they’re exploring solutions.
- And in the final stage, they’re ready to make a purchase.
- Tailoring your content to these stages can boost your chances of conversion.
