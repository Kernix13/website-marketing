## Blog

- for a professional site your "Blog" should be called "Articles" in my opinion. Blog sounds less professional

### Best practices for blog content

1. Catchy headlines
2. Short paragraphs
3. Interesting images and graphics
4. Regular posting schedule

### Repurposing old blog posts

- Update the blog post with new information, remove outdated tips, change up the title and CTA, add new links, etc
- Write a best-of-the-year post
- Write round-up posts - ?
- Write a best-of-the-year post - ?
- Update and promote old eBooks, guides, etc. - ?
- Turn blog posts into videos or animations: For B2B companies and small businesses, one of the smartest ways to reach your audience is by turning a meaty blog post into a visually stunning video or animated presentation. You can then share it via a blog post and on social media. Work with a graphic designer to ensure your presentation is as polished and beautiful as possible. Yes, this will take some time, but your efforts will pay off

## Videos

Video content is modern and visual

### Best practices for video content

1. How-to videos. Whenever you post a “How-To,” whether written or video, you’re demonstrating that you’re an authority on your product. Use videos when the procedure is better explained visually
2. Product videos - N/A
3. Publish transcripts. Including a transcript of your video will improve your SEO ranking, as search engines cannot yet handle video as text. It will also appeal to your shoppers that prefer reading.
4. Live streaming. Videos that allow viewers to engage with brands in real-time are booming as a content marketing strategy. The live-streaming industry grew 99% between 2019 and 2020 and is expected to be worth over $184 billion by 2027.

## Social media

Posts on social media can drive traffic to your main site, attract new buyers, develop more personal relationships with shoppers, and promote sales events and campaigns

### Best practices for social media content

> Some questionable things in this section IMO

1. Engage with your viewers: you can start conversations as well as respond. For the best relationship building, the street should run both ways. Asking your followers questions is a great way to get conversations started.
2. Apply the 70-20-10 Rule. Many professional media marketers use this rule:

   - 70% – posts that are relevant to your products, but not self-promotional
   - 20% – shared content
   - 10% – self-promotional content

3. Pay attention to platform demographics. Be sure that you are using the right social media platforms for your target audience. The following are some industry user demographics for the most popular social media sites:
   - Twitter – ages 18-29 (34.1% female, 61.29% male)
   - Facebook – ages 25-34 (44% female, 56% male)
   - Pinterest – ages 25-34 (76.2% female, 17% male)
   - Instagram – ages 18-24 (48.2% female, 51.8% male)
   - Snapchat – ages 18-24 (51% female, 48% male)
   - TikTok – ages 18-24 (54% female, 46% male)
4. Use a posting tool. There are many posting tools available that will remember to post for you on a schedule, so you don’t have to set any alarms. It’s as easy as entering your posts and then they will publish on their own when you schedule them. Hootsuite and Sendible are two of the most popular.

## Email

> Not applicable IMO except maybe surveys that will allow you to improve your site based on the feedback you receive

### Best practices for email content

- Compose creative subject lines
- Personalize
- Use transactional emails
  - Welcome email
  - Follow-up email
  - Abandoned cart email
